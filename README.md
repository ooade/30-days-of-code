# 30-days-of-code
Daily log of the things I read and learn during week days, and maybe weekends.
This may include stuffs on web performance, css, javascript, accessibility, reactjs and golang :)

#### Golang
Resource: [The go programming language](https://www.gopl.io/)
- I learnt about the short hand variable declaration in go (`i := "some value"`)
- The os package. With thiss you can get the list of arguments from the command line using `os.Args`
- The range method. Applied to `os.Args`, you'll get `index` and `value`.
- A cool one from the strings package(`strings.Join`). Short and precise :)
