# 30-days-of-code
Daily log of the things I read and learn during week days, and maybe weekends.
This may include stuffs on web performance, css, javascript, accessibility, reactjs and golang :)

#### Golang
Resource: [The go programming language](https://www.gopl.io/)
- I learnt about the short hand variable declaration in go (`i := "some value"`)
- The os package. With this you can get the list of arguments from the command line using `os.Args`
- The range method. Applied to `os.Args`, you'll get `index` and `value`.
- A cool one from the strings package(`strings.Join`). Short and precise :)

#### Performance
Resource: [What is first input delay](https://bitsofco.de/what-is-first-input-delay/)
- Hot one from Ire. FID metric is like the intersection between FCP(The time content starts to show on the webpage) and FMP(The time you have meaningful content on the page).
- It's more like the time one will be able to use form inputs on the page.
